# Dynamics_Graphs
MATLAB codes and app for visualizing free and forced vibrations and related inferences of a springâ€“massâ€“damper system in Structural Dynamics.


# Structural Dynamics with MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB codes and a simple App Designer project for visualizing vibration responses of a **springâ€“massâ€“damper system**.  
All derivations are based on the **free-body diagram (FBD)**, leading to the governing differential equation and its inferences and phenomenon:

\[
Equation of Motion:  
m*u''(t) + c*u'(t) + k*u(t) = P0 * sin(Ï‰t)
\]

## ðŸ“Š Topics Covered
- Free Undamped Vibration
- Free Damped Vibration
- Forced Undamped Vibration
- Forced Damped Vibration
- Transmissibility vs frequency & damping
- Resonance build-up
- Amplitude decay with cycles
- Comparisons of critical, subcritical & overcritical damping

---

## ðŸ–¥ MATLAB App
The repository also includes a simple **Springâ€“Massâ€“Damper Analyzer App** built with MATLAB App Designer.  
It allows interactive visualization of displacement, velocity, and acceleration responses for different system parameters.
